"""ask_user_question — structured multiple-choice prompt for the operator.

Pauses the running graph via ``langgraph.types.interrupt`` and emits a
structured ``ask_user_question`` custom event so the CLI can render a picker.
The CLI resumes the run with ``Command(resume=<choice>)`` and the chosen
value flows back as the tool's return value.

Argument validation is delegated to Pydantic via the @tool's auto-generated
args_schema — the LLM sees the constraints as part of the tool signature so
no prose schema lives in the prompt. The deterministic ``InjectedToolCallId``
is included in the emitted event so the CLI can deduplicate the second
emission that LangGraph performs when ToolNode re-executes the tool body
after resume.
