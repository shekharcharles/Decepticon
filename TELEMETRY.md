# Decepticon Telemetry

Decepticon can send **anonymous usage telemetry** to help maintainers see what
users ask the agents to do and what the agents actually do. It is **opt-in** and
designed for a red-team threat model: **raw prompts, targets, credentials, and
tool output are never transmitted.**

## TL;DR

- **Off by default.** Nothing is sent unless you set `DECEPTICON_TELEMETRY=basic`
  (or `research`) **and** a `DECEPTICON_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT`.
- **`DO_NOT_TRACK=1`** (or `decepticon-cli telemetry off`) forces it off forever.
- **See exactly what would be sent:** `decepticon-cli telemetry preview`.

## Controls

| Variable / command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `DECEPTICON_TELEMETRY=off\|basic\|research` | consent mode (default `off`) |
| `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` | standard kill switch — forces `off` |
| `DECEPTICON_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT=<url>` | gateway URL; unset ⇒ nothing is sent |
| `decepticon-cli telemetry status` | show resolved mode / endpoint / anonymous id |
| `decepticon-cli telemetry preview` | print the exact payload for a sample run |
| `decepticon-cli telemetry off` / `on` | persistent opt-out marker (overrides env) |

## What is collected

Two consent tiers map to the data tiers in the design doc:

- **`basic` → Tier A (structural ground truth, always safe):** event type, agent
  name, tool name (e.g. `nmap`), normalized status, bucketed sizes, token counts,
  model id — **plus the classification the engagement itself produces**, derived
  from the `Finding` model and OPPLAN tracker (not inferred from your prompt):

  | Event | Fields collected | Never collected |
  |---|---|---|
  | `finding.created` | `severity`, `cwe`, `mitre_techniques`, `phase`, `confidence`, `detected` (purple-team), `agent` | finding title/description, `affected_target`, evidence, PoC |
  | `opplan.update` | `phase` (recon→…→exfiltration), `status_objective` (pending/blocked/…) | objective title/notes |
  | `tool.result` | `tool`, `status`, `output_bucket` | tool output |

  This is how maintainers learn **what the tool actually finds and where
  engagements stall** (e.g. CWE/severity distribution = what it detects; `blocked`
  clusters at a phase = where it fails) — entirely from the agent's structured
  artifacts, never from prompt text.

- **`research` → the reasoning corpus:** additionally the red-team **reasoning**
  — your objectives, the agent's chain-of-thought / tactic rationale, the commands
  it runs, and the observations — captured **as-is** so the attacker reasoning is
  preserved for training future autonomous red-team agents. **Target identifiers
  are MASKED** (`10.0.0.5` → `<HOST_1>`, creds → `<CRED_1>`) so the reasoning stays
  intact but no real target/credential is shared. Enable with
  `decepticon-cli telemetry enable research` (it prints the disclosure first).

  **Consent boundary:** the agent's reasoning is yours to share. The *target's*
  data — IPs, hosts, domains, credentials, client/org names — is masked even here,
  because a third party's data is not yours to consent away.

Every batch carries a non-identifying envelope: a random `install_id` (a UUID
minted on first use — never machine- or IP-derived), the Decepticon version, and
the OS family (`linux`/`darwin`/`windows`).

### Example (exactly what leaves the machine)

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "tier": "A",
  "install_id": "1e9a73a6-c8bd-4e1e-be02-78f4b11de4e1",
  "client": { "decepticon_version": "1.1.13", "os": "linux" },
  "events": [
    { "type": "tool.call",   "ts": 2.0, "agent": "recon", "tool": "bash" },
    { "type": "tool.result", "ts": 3.0, "agent": "recon", "tool": "bash",
      "status": "ok", "output_bucket": "1k-10k" },
    { "type": "finding.created", "ts": 4.0, "agent": "exploit",
      "tool": "validate_finding", "cwe": ["CWE-89"], "mitre_techniques": ["T1190"] }
  ]
}
```

### Example — a `research` trajectory (masked, role-labeled, ordered)

Each step carries a **`role`** (human input / agent output / tool execution), a
per-engagement **`session_id`**, and a monotonic **`step`** — so the whole
trajectory reconstructs in order (`WHERE session_id = X ORDER BY step`) into the
turn sequence a training pipeline needs. Identifiers are masked throughout:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "tier": "R",
  "install_id": "1e9a73a6-…",
  "client": { "decepticon_version": "1.1.13", "os": "linux" },
  "events": [
    { "type": "trajectory.step", "session_id": "a1b2c3d4e5f60718", "step": 0,
      "role": "human", "agent": "decepticon", "text": "Objective: own the host at <HOST_1>" },
    { "type": "trajectory.step", "session_id": "a1b2c3d4e5f60718", "step": 1,
      "role": "agent", "agent": "exploit",
      "text": "the login at <DOMAIN_1> on <HOST_1> looks injectable — try UNION-based SQLi" },
    { "type": "trajectory.step", "session_id": "a1b2c3d4e5f60718", "step": 2,
      "role": "tool", "agent": "exploit", "tool": "bash",
      "args_text": "sqlmap -u <URL_1> --batch", "observation": "dumped 12 rows from <HOST_1>" }
  ]
}
```

The reasoning structure is intact (training value preserved); `<HOST_1>` is the
same placeholder every time that host recurs in the session, but the real target
/ credentials never leave the machine. `session_id` is a hash (the engagement
name may carry a client/org name, so it is never sent raw).

## What is NEVER collected (Tier C)

Raw prompts, target IPs / domains / hosts, credentials, file contents, tool
output, and client/org names. These are blocked by **three independent layers**:

1. **Shape redaction at the source** — `EventLogMiddleware` already records
   shapes, not contents (`<str:42>`, `***REDACTED***`).
2. **Client Tier-C scan** — before anything is queued, a fail-closed scanner
   drops any event that still matches an IP / cred / host pattern.
3. **Gateway Tier-C reject** — the ingest gateway re-scans and rejects, and
   drops the client IP (it never reaches the analytics backend).

## How it is sent

Events are **batched, gzipped, and sent best-effort** to the gateway over HTTPS.
Failures (offline, gateway down) are silently dropped — telemetry never blocks
or breaks an engagement. The gateway holds the analytics backend credential, so
the OSS client only ever knows the public endpoint URL.

See `telemetry-gateway/README.md` for the gateway, and
`docs/design/2026-06-20-telemetry-data-collection-design.md` for the full design.
