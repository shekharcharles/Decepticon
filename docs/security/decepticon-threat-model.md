# Threat Model — Decepticon as a Target

> Decepticon is an autonomous offensive tool. That makes it a high-value
> target. This document is the STRIDE walk of Decepticon's own attack
> surface so operators, plugin authors, and SaaS deployers can reason
> about compromise paths against the agent itself.

## Scope

Three trust planes:

1. **Operator plane.** The human running Decepticon, their workstation,
   their Claude/OpenAI/Codex OAuth tokens, the `.env` file with API
   keys.
2. **Management plane.** Everything on `decepticon-net`: LangGraph,
   LiteLLM, PostgreSQL, Neo4j, the Next.js web dashboard.
3. **Operational plane.** Everything on `sandbox-net`: the Kali
   sandbox, Sliver C2 server (when active), target infrastructure.

Bridges between planes are the highest-impact compromise paths.

The four bridges, in decreasing blast radius:

| Bridge | Carries | Compromised → |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Neo4j dual-homing** | Cypher / APOC procedures | sandbox → mgmt plane RCE if APOC procedures are unrestricted |
| **LiteLLM** | OAuth files + provider API keys | full LLM-provider compromise; engagement spend; cross-customer cred theft |
| **Plugin entry-points** | Arbitrary Python on `import decepticon` | `pip install` of one malicious bundle → agent-startup RCE |
| **Web dashboard** | OPPLAN edits, operator overrides, engagement state | full agent control if web is exposed without auth (PR #338) |

## STRIDE walk

Per-asset analysis.

### Asset: Neo4j

### Asset: LiteLLM container

| Threat | Vector | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|

| **Tampering** | LiteLLM admin UI mutates routing | Master key never exposed to sandbox network | Done |
| **Information disclosure** | OAuth credential files bind-mounted (Claude/Codex) | Bind RO; LiteLLM container itself is on `decepticon-net` only | Done |

### Asset: Sandbox container

| Threat | Vector | Mitigation | Status |

## Highest-impact compromise chains

The chains that matter, ranked by realistic damage:

1. **Hostile banner → APOC → mgmt env exfil.** A target webpage returns text that influences the agent's next `kg_query` call. Pre-hardening, agent issues `CALL apoc.cypher.runFile('file:///proc/self/environ')`; the response carries PostgreSQL creds, LiteLLM master key, OAuth tokens. **Closed** by allowlist-only APOC + UntrustedOutput envelope (Tier 1, Tier 4a).

2. **Cross-engagement data leak via web dashboard.** Any authenticated user opens `engagements/<their-id>/graph`; the route ran `MATCH (n) OPTIONAL MATCH (n)-[r]->(m)` against the shared Neo4j. Hostile customer reads competitor's findings. **Closed** by Prisma ownership + per-engagement label scoping (Tier 4b).

3. **Operator workstation → LiteLLM OAuth file read.** Operator's `~/.claude/.credentials.json` is bind-mounted RO into LiteLLM. Compromised host with read on that file gets the OAuth token. **Mitigation**: the file is RO mounted only into LiteLLM, not into sandbox; standard OS file perms (600) apply to operator host. **Status**: partial — relies on operator host hygiene.

4. **Plugin entry-point poisoning.** Operator runs `pip install decepticon-plugin-foo` from a typosquat. Bundle's `__init__.py` exfiltrates `.env` at agent startup. **Closed** by `DECEPTICON_PLUGINS` allowlist; **Open** signed-bundle verification.

5. **Prompt-injection-driven RCE via docker socket.** The old `DockerSandbox` transport mounted `/var/run/docker.sock` into the LangGraph container; any agent-controlled command could escape to the host. **Closed** by the HTTP-only sandbox transport rewrite (predates this PR; see [`backends/factory.py`](../../packages/decepticon/decepticon/backends/factory.py)).

## Future hardening

Tracked in this PR's roadmap, in order of priority:

1. **Per-engagement Cypher user** (`decepticon-sandbox-<engagement>`, rotating Bolt token). Caps the impact of a single sandbox compromise to that engagement's portion of the graph.
2. **Per-engagement sandbox container** (Docker SDK based lifecycle, one container per engagement open). Eliminates the "Engagement A's `.scratch/` is visible to Engagement B" leak. Tier 3 of this PR ships the design + compose hardening; full lifecycle ships in a follow-up.
3. **Per-engagement budget cap** (token / dollar threshold per LiteLLM virtual key, downgrades to lower tier at threshold, hard-stops at 2x).
4. **Plugin bundle signature** (PluginBundle ships an Ed25519 signature; operator pins trust set; `pip install` of an unpinned bundle is rejected at boot).
5. **Firecracker microVM sandbox** (one ~125ms-boot microVM per objective). Kernel boundary instead of namespace boundary. SaaS-only; OSS keeps Docker.
6. **Sigstore-style transparent log** for the RoE audit ledger. Today the ledger lives next to the engagement workspace; the HMAC key is operator-held. For paid engagements, ship the chain hash to a third-party transparency log (Rekor) so even the operator can't rewrite history.

## Out of scope

This document does NOT cover:

- **Target-side threat model**: that's the customer's domain.
- **OpenAI/Anthropic/Google provider trust**: Decepticon trusts the upstream LLM providers' published security posture.
- **Operator workstation hardening**: standard endpoint hygiene applies.
- **Network ingress filtering** above what compose provides: deployers responsible for firewalling beyond `127.0.0.1:*` exposed ports.
